    <h3>How to play</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Before starting a race, choose your character by selecting "Select Uma" on the right side of the screen.</li>
      <li>There are many characters available—pick your favorite to compete with.</li>
      <li>You can view each character's base speed stats by clicking the "->" button on the left side of the screen.</li>
      <li>Once you've made your choice, close the panel by pressing "Done" at the bottom.</li>
      <li>Then select "Start Race" to begin racing with your chosen character.</li>
      <li style="color: red;">Note: You cannot start a race unless you have selected a character.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>During a race</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You will compete against 6 other characters on a track that is 8000 pixels long.</li>
      <li>The race runs automatically, so you don’t need to plan strategy—just watch it unfold.</li>
      <li>Every character receives a random speed boost between 0.0-0.9 every five seconds during the race.</li>
      <li>Your chosen character will activate their unique skill to boost speed at a random time between 70-100 seconds after the race begins.</li>
      <li>Each opponent also has the potential to activate their unique skill at a random time between 70–100 seconds after the race begins. Not all opponents will necessarily trigger it in every race.</li>
      <li>Each skill lasts for 10 seconds and can only be used once per race.</li>
      <li>Notifications in the top left corner of the screen show which character has activated a unique skill.</li>
      <li>At the bottom left of the screen, there is also notification that will appear for any character that reaches the finish line.</li>
    </ul>
